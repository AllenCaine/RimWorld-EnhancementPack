(Also check the settings in-game for feature list)

Overlays for unbuildable areas, terrain fertility, and lighting.
Trade and negotiation dialogs can pause after closing.
Level-up arrows indicate skill learning in Character Tab.
Zone/Stockpile size count, accounting fertility. Empty/Fully grown plant count.
Areas can be reordered, recolored, and copy/pasted in the area manager

(various) selected items are given a count
Food 'rotted away' messages are clickable to see where it was
Popup messages like '% recruit chance' (text motes) stay onscreen in realtime, so they don't dissappear at high speeds

A stop button for your pawns. Because, sometimes you want them to stop.
